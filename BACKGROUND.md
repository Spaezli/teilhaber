Teilhaber:in Background
===

_A prototype started at Hack4SocialGood 2024_

**Promotion \~ Perception \~ Diversity \~ Research \~ Inspiration**

We created **Teilhaber:in** - a tool for people like you and me, to discover opportunities to participate - while contributing to better understanding of the landscape of participation.

Our prototype is completely open source (licensed using the [Unilicense](https://github.com/Spaezli/teilhaber/blob/main/LICENSE)), and produces open data that will help social workers and researchers to analyze the impact of participative projects and events. The software architecture is based on "no code" principles: a flexible survey builder gives the opportunity to inexpensively and easily continue building on the solution.

Check out our sample on the new DataHub Cloud:

Tools used:

- [Flet](https://Flet.dev/) ([Apache license](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme)) - mobile/desktop/web app framework 
- [Baserow](https://baserow.io/) ([mixed license](https://github.com/bram2w/baserow?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme)) - user friendly database and form builder
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) ([MIT license](https://git.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/tree/LICENSE)) - web scraping and parsing

All of these tools are open source, and coded using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

### Next steps:

- Connect to event sites \([Hinto](https://hinto.ch) etc. - see [our notes here](https://hackmd.io/@oleg/rJzXIfeb0)\)
- Deploy application to the public (WIP)
- Further analysis & development

_A sketch of our hackathon concept_

## Challenge

Democracy depends on as many people and groups as possible taking part in shaping society. There are various programmes and projects in the canton of Zurich that aim to promote participation. To date, however, there is still no well-founded data on how the population perceives its opportunities for participation. In order to be able to systematically collect this data, a digital survey tool is to be developed using the citizen science method. In this way, residents of the Canton of Zurich will be able to participate directly in the research process and thus contribute to greater participation. The questions that arise here are:

- How should such a citizen science project be designed?
- What questions should we ask the people of Zurich in order to research their perceived participation?
- How can a digital application contribute to the establishment of a data basis in relation to participation in the canton of Zurich?
